To expand the main content to the right, filling the space of what is normally occupied by the table of contents. Add
the following to a post or page’s YAML Front Matter:

```yaml
classes: wide
```

Note: If the page contains a table of contents, it will no longer appear to the right. Instead it will be forced into
the main content container directly following the page’s title.
