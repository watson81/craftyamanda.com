To add some visual punch to a post or page, a large full-width header image can be included.

Be sure to resize your header images. ~1280px is a good width if you arenâ€™t responsively serving up images. Through the
magic of CSS they will scale up or down to fill the container. If you go with something too small it will look like
garbage when upscaled, and something too large will hurt performance.
